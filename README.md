# Booktracker
Automatically updates my 'Books Read' spreadsheet using information from the book's [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) page. The information includes:  

**Book Title**  
**Series Name and Book # in Series (if applicable)**  
**Author**  
**Number of Pages**  
**Fiction or Nonfiction**  
**Genre**  

It also adds **Date Finished** - which defaults to today but can be set to yesterday's date or a custom date through a sys argument - and automatically updates the necessary formulas for keeping track of the **Most Read Author** and **Most Read Genre**.

All this is done to both the current years tracking sheet and the 'Overall' sheet.
